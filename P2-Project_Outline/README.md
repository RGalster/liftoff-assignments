## Submission Instructions

### Overview
In my local community of Philadelphia PA it has recently come to my attention that there is growing demand for an online hub for kids volleyball events and organizations.  Such a web site could be a place for organizations to list details about themselves and a place for the public to discover what’s going on in their locale.  Fledgling organizations would also have a place to reach out for ideas, support, and guidance.  This web site would also have the potential to expand it’s reach to similar towns with similar needs and resources.
### Features
Features to include might be:
    • list your organization and its details
    • post details about an event
    • search through organizations, events, and other resources on the site
    • an ‘about’ page with a link for sharing
### Technologies
Tech stack:
    • .Net
    • MySQL
    • JavaScript, HTML, and CSS (most likely)
### What I'll Have to Learn
I would like this to be a project that could go live in the near future so I’ll have to learn more about hosting and remote databases.  Big features that would be great to implement would be using maps to allow a search within a given radius (perhaps with google maps) and having the ability to view the site in multiple languages (Spanish, Vietnamese, etc).
